# TIVM-master

This is the demo code for: "Outlier-Robust Geometric Perception: A Novel Thresholding-Based Estimator with Intra-Class Variance Maximization", for academic use only

1) test_RotAvg.m is the test file for robust rotation averaging (could run directly);

2) test_PointCloudReg.m is the test file for robust point cloud registration (could run directly);

3) test_CategoryPerception.m is the test file for robust category-level perception; Before running it, please download gloptipoly3 (https://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/software/gloptipoly/) and SeDuMi 1.3 (https://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/?page_id=58) to the 'lib' folder
